# README Generator

## Description

This project is a README.md generator that utilizes Node.js , npm, and Inquirer. Using this application, you can create a README.md file directly from your terminal. All GitHub projects need a README file, so this application was made to make that process easier for GitHub users. Using Inquirer, the terminal prompts you to answer questions, and the Node.js File System creates a new README file.

I learned a ton about Node.js throughout this project, especially using the file system to create files. I also learned a lot about module.exports and requiring npm files and other JS files.

## Installation

To install this project, please download the GitHub repository.

## Usage

After, installing the GitHub repository, right click on the "index.js" file in VS Code (or whatever program you're using) and open it in the integrated terminal. Type in "node index" and the terminal will begin the process.
